## Overview {#sec-overview}

For my final project, it is my goal to understand the relationship between pre-conception iron biomarkers and miscarriage risk. Specifically, I will be investigating this question among women with prior pregnancy loss, using data from the EAGeR (Effects of Aspirin in Gestation and Reproduction) trial.

Two faculty members I met with to discuss this project: Sunni Mumford, Professor & Deputy Director, Epidemiology Ellen Caniglia, Assistant Professor, Epidemiology

Sunni Mumford has worked with EAGeR data before and informed me about the EAGeR data structure and best practices for the analyses. We discussed the feasibility of my research question; data is available within EAGeR on both iron biomarkers and miscarriage. Iron biomarker data is from baseline (preconception) and pregnancy loss data is collected during follow-up with the time metric being gestational weeks until miscarriage or birth. Ellen Caniglia encouraged me to perform a literature review to determine which iron biomarker may be best to use and after discussion, we decided on serum ferritin. With both Dr. Mumford and Dr. Caniglia, I discussed potential confounders based on the literature.

## Introduction {#sec-introduction}

Miscarriage, defined as the spontaneous loss of a pregnancy before 20 weeks of gestation, is a common and emotionally devastating outcome, affecting approximately 10–20% of recognized pregnancies. Despite its prevalence, the underlying causes of miscarriage are not fully understood, particularly among women with a history of pregnancy loss. Iron, an essential micronutrient involved in oxygen transport, hormone synthesis, and cellular function, plays a critical role in reproductive health. Iron deficiency—even in the absence of anemia—has been associated with impaired implantation, placental development, and increased miscarriage risk. Serum ferritin, a biomarker of iron stores, is particularly relevant in assessing iron status in women of reproductive age. This final project aims to investigate whether preconception serum ferritin levels are associated with miscarriage risk among women with prior pregnancy loss, using data from the EAGeR (Effects of Aspirin in Gestation and Reproduction) trial. This research is inherently interdisciplinary, integrating perspectives from epidemiology, reproductive biology, nutrition science, and biostatistics. Epidemiological methods are essential for analyzing longitudinal data and identifying confounding factors, while reproductive biology provides insight into how iron status may influence implantation and early gestational development. Nutrition science contributes to understanding iron metabolism and its biomarkers, and biostatistics enables rigorous modeling of time-to-event outcomes. The EAGeR trial provides a unique opportunity to explore the relationship between serum ferritin and miscarriage, as it includes detailed data on preconception serum ferritin levels and prospective tracking of pregnancy outcomes by gestational week. Identifying relevant confounders such as age, BMI, and parity is essential for isolating the true effect of iron status, and integrating insights from epidemiology, nutrition science, and reproductive biology is critical to fully understanding this complex relationship.

## Methods {#sec-methods}

**Study Population** This study utilizes data from the Effects of Aspirin in Gestation and Reproduction (EAGeR) trial, a multi-site randomized controlled trial designed to evaluate the impact of low-dose aspirin on reproductive outcomes. The analytic sample includes 1,228 women aged 18–40 years who had experienced one or two prior pregnancy losses and were actively attempting to conceive. Participants were followed until miscarriage or birth occurred, with pregnancy outcomes tracked in gestational weeks.

**Exposure Assessment** The primary exposure of interest is iron status, measured via serum ferritin concentrations at baseline (preconception). Serum ferritin was assessed using standardized immunoassays, with quality control procedures including re-testing of samples to ensure reliability. Serum ferritin is selected as the primary biomarker due to its clinical relevance and widespread use in assessing iron stores. Iron deficiency is commonly defined as serum ferritin \<15 µg/L by the World Health Organization (WHO), but recent literature suggests a cutoff of \<30 µg/L may improve sensitivity and specificity in both healthy and clinical populations. Ferritin levels are dichotomized at the \<30 µg/L threshold for analysis.

**Outcome Measurement** The primary outcome is miscarriage, defined as a chemical or clinical loss of pregnancy. 

**Covariates** Potential confounders were identified through literature review and include: age, Body Mass Index (BMI), race/ethnicity, parity, household income, use of prenatal vitamins, physical activity, smoking status, and aspirin treatment assignment. These covariates are of interest because they may influence both iron status and miscarriage risk. Age is a well-established risk factor for miscarriage and may also affect iron stores. BMI can alter ferritin levels through inflammation and is linked to adverse reproductive outcomes. Race/ethnicity captures biological and social differences that influence diet, iron metabolism, and pregnancy outcomes. Parity reflects prior reproductive history, which can deplete iron stores and affect miscarriage risk. Household income serves as a proxy for socioeconomic status, influencing diet quality and access to care. Prenatal vitamin use is relevant because supplements often contain iron, potentially modifying ferritin levels. Physical activity may impact inflammation and iron metabolism, while extreme activity has been associated with miscarriage. Smoking is included due to its known association with adverse pregnancy outcomes and potential effects on nutrient absorption. Finally, aspirin treatment assignment is controlled for as part of the EAGeR trial design, given its possible influence on implantation and miscarriage risk.

**Statistical Analysis** Descriptive statistics summarize the distribution of serum ferritin and covariates. Two versions of Table 1 present baseline characteristics stratified by serum ferritin status (\<30 µg/L vs. ≥30 µg/L; \<15 µg/L vs. ≥15 µg/L). Risk ratios are estimated using a Poisson regression model with a log link and robust standard errors, implemented via the survey package (svyglm) in R. This model is chosen because it provides a reliable way to estimate risk ratios directly for binary outcomes, avoiding convergence issues common in log-binomial models. Initial models are unadjusted, followed by adjusted models incorporating identified covariates. Inverse probability weights were applied to account for selection into pregnancy. Sensitivity analyses explore the use of the WHO ferritin cutoff as an alternative metric for iron deficiency and stratifying by potential effect modifiers.

Among 1,228 participants, 982 had valid serum ferritin levels measured; serum ferritin levels varied across categories. Using the 30 µg/L cutoff, 294 women (29.9%) had ferritin <30 µg/L and 688 (70.1%) had ferritin ≥30 µg/L. Women with ferritin <30 µg/L were more likely to be parous (65% vs. 56%, p=0.013). Income also differed significantly (p=0.011), with a higher proportion of women in the <30 µg/L group reporting income <$40,000 (38% vs. 29%). Other characteristics, including age, BMI, race, prenatal vitamin use, exercise level, aspirin treatment assignment, and smoking status were similar across ferritin categories.

Using the 15 µg/L cutoff, 91 women (9.3%) had ferritin <15 µg/L and 891 (90.7%) had ferritin ≥15 µg/L. Women with ferritin <15 µg/L were more likely to have higher BMI (p=0.008), be parous (71% vs. 57%, p=0.009), and report lower income (p=0.023). Race also differed significantly (p=0.005), with non-White participants more common in the <15 µg/L group (12% vs. 4.9%). Exercise level varied by ferritin status (p=0.039), with low activity more frequent among women with ferritin <15 µg/L (40% vs. 27%). Age, prenatal vitamin use, treatment assignment, and smoking status did not differ significantly between groups.

In total, 157 pregnancy losses occurred among 637 women who had serum ferritin measured at baseline, conceived, and have non-missing covariate data. Using the 30 μg/L cutoff, 125 cases occurred among women with ferritin ≥30 μg/L and 32 cases among those with ferritin <30 μg/L. In unadjusted analyses, women with ferritin <30 μg/L had a lower risk of pregnancy loss compared to those with ferritin ≥30 μg/L (RR = 0.76; 95% CI: 0.46, 0.94). After adjustment for age, BMI, race, parity, income, smoking status, prenatal vitamin use, exercise level, and aspirin treatment assignment, the association remained similar (adjusted RR = 0.70; 95% CI: 0.49, 1.00).

In a sensitivity analysis using a 15 μg/L cutoff for serum ferritin, 9 pregnancy losses occurred among women with ferritin <15 μg/L compared to 148 losses among those with ferritin ≥15 μg/L. The unadjusted risk ratio for pregnancy loss in the <15 μg/L group was 0.63 (95% CI: 0.34, 1.19). After adjustment for covariates, the association remained similar (adjusted RR = 0.71; 95% CI: 0.37, 1.35). These findings were consistent with the primary analysis, but did not indicate a statistically significant association between low ferritin and pregnancy loss.
Stratified analyses by parity using the 30 μg/L cutoff revealed differing patterns. Among nulliparous women, pregnancy loss occurred in 17 women with ferritin <30 μg/L and 53 women with ferritin ≥30 μg/L. The adjusted risk ratio was 0.96 (95% CI: 0.58, 1.59), indicating no significant association. In contrast, among parous women, pregnancy loss occurred in 15 women with ferritin <30 μg/L and 72 women with ferritin ≥30 μg/L. Here, lower ferritin was associated with a significantly reduced risk of pregnancy loss (adjusted HR = 0.52; 95% CI: 0.32, 0.87).
Stratified analyses by BMI category using the 30 μg/L cutoff also showed differing patterns. Among women with BMI <25 kg/m², the adjusted risk ratio was 0.53 (95% CI: 0.32, 0.90). For BMI 25–30 kg/m², the adjusted risk ratio was 0.99 (95% CI: 0.50, 1.97), and for BMI >30 kg/m², it was 0.76 (95% CI: 0.36, 1.64). Confidence intervals included 1 across all strata except for the BMI <25 kg/m² group.

## Conclusion

In this study of women with prior pregnancy loss enrolled in the EAGeR trial, lower preconception serum ferritin levels (<30 μg/L) were not associated with an increased risk of miscarriage; in fact, point estimates suggested a modest protective effect, though confidence intervals in the adjusted models were close to the null, indicating uncertainty about the association. Sensitivity analyses using a 15 μg/L cutoff and stratification by parity and BMI revealed potential effect modification: the inverse association was strongest among parous women and those with BMI <25 kg/m². However, these findings should be interpreted cautiously given limited sample sizes and residual confounding. Overall, these results do not support the hypothesis that low preconception ferritin increases miscarriage risk in this population. Future research should explore biological mechanisms underlying these patterns and assess whether iron supplementation strategies should be tailored by parity or BMI.
